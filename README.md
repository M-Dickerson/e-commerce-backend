# E-Commerce Backend

## Description

The motivation and purpose behind this project was to create the backend for an e-commerce website. It solves the issue of not having a functioning backend that can be used to update prices and inventory stock. I learned a lot about using proper syntax such as adding missing commas and taking out unused spaces. I also learned a lot about using Insomnia.
